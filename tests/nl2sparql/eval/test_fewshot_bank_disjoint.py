"""Leakage gate for the curated few-shot bank (Phase 7 Plan 02, D-01/D-02/B2).

``fewshot_bank.yml`` supplies the question -> gold-SPARQL exemplars the
dense/BM25 few-shot retrievers rank over. This module is the committed,
after-the-fact proof that the bank does NOT contaminate the held-out eval
``corpus.yml``:

1. ``test_bank_disjoint_from_eval_corpus`` -- THREE-way disjointness:
   normalized question text, canonical algebra (alpha-equivalence aware, via
   the existing ``runner._canonical`` judge), and a canonical-algebra
   SKELETON (concrete literals/URIs abstracted) so neither a paraphrase, a
   re-spelled-but-equivalent gold, nor a numerically-nudged near-clone
   (``:age 30`` vs ``:age 40``) can smuggle a corpus case into the bank.
2. ``test_bank_similarity_ceiling`` -- a cosine SIMILARITY CEILING (< 0.95)
   using the same pinned embedding model the dense retriever uses, so a
   near-clone paraphrase can never clear the gate and hand the model a
   template. Skips (does not fail) when the dense stack is not installed --
   this plan is independent of 07-01/07-03's dense-stack sync.
3. ``test_every_bank_gold_parses`` -- a bank exemplar that cannot parse is a
   broken few-shot example.
4. ``test_bank_ontology_matches_corpus`` -- WARNING 4: the duplicated
   ``ontology:`` Turtle block cannot silently drift between the two files.

A collision surfaced by this gate is a signal to RE-AUTHOR the offending
bank item, never to nudge a literal to dodge the check (B2).

Key-free / mostly no-network: reuses ``runner._canonical``/``_load_corpus``
(the existing canonical-algebra judge) and mirrors ``test_gold_transpilable.py``'s
``pytest.mark.eval`` + ``RUN_EVAL`` skip idiom. Only the similarity-ceiling
test touches a (locally cached, pinned-revision) sentence-transformers model,
and it degrades to a skip rather than a hard failure when that stack is
absent.

# Overlap-Audit Design":
#
#   1. SHAPE overlap -- reuses `_skeleton` (this module's own canonical-
#      algebra-with-abstracted-literals/URIs helper, the seed for this axis
#      per RESEARCH): a generated example whose skeleton equals a held-out
#      gold's skeleton is a near-duplicate-SHAPE. This axis is EXPECTED to
#      be non-trivial by design -- the generator's whole purpose is
#      producing SAME-shape examples for BM25 retrieval -- so it is
#      REPORTED (indices exported for exclusion), never asserted empty.
#   2. ENTITY overlap (new, D-04/D-05 leakage axis, Pitfall 4) -- literal
#      fillers appearing in BOTH the generated bank and the held-out gold
#      queries. Unlike shape overlap, entity-level leakage is a genuine
#      contamination risk (the model could see the SAME real-world name a
#      held-out question is grounded in).
#
# Both helpers are importable so `run_generated_sweep.py` (Plan 05 Task 2)
# computes the overlap-EXCLUDED delta from this exact source of truth,
# never a re-derived copy (REQ-6).
