"""Adapter seams that plug ``arango_sparql`` into the shared NL engine.

The language-agnostic :class:`arango_query_core.nl.engine.NLQueryEngine`
owns the generate → validate → repair *flow* and token accounting, but it
cannot know anything SPARQL-specific or anything about *this* service's
audit/cost bookkeeping. Those concerns live here, as two small pieces the
pipeline injects into the engine:

* :class:`EngineProviderBridge` — adapts our
  :class:`~arango_sparql.nl2sparql.client.LLMClient`
  (``generate(messages) -> LLMResponse``) to the engine's
  :class:`~arango_query_core.nl.providers.LLMProvider` protocol
  (``generate(system, user) -> (content, usage_dict)``). It also owns the
  per-call :class:`~arango_sparql.nl2sparql.models.LLMCallRecord` audit
  trail (RESEARCH work-item 3, option (b): the bridge records one record
  per provider call, since the engine's ``NLResult`` only carries token
  *totals*, not per-call provider/model/cost).

* :class:`SparqlAdapter` — implements the five
  :class:`~arango_query_core.nl.seams.QueryLanguageAdapter` seams, each
  mapped onto a shipped ``nl2sparql`` / transpiler piece. Its ``validate``
  seam runs against the resolver **injected into the constructor** (the
  pipeline's own ``self.resolver``), never a resolver rebuilt from
  ``ontology_ttl`` — so a mapping-JSON / analyzer-enriched request (where
  ``ontology_ttl`` is ``""`` but the resolver is populated) validates
  against the same schema the pipeline's final re-translate will use.

The pipeline (see :mod:`arango_sparql.nl2sparql.pipeline`) wires these two
into ``NLQueryEngine`` in Wave 3; isolating them here lets the
verdict-reproduction, record-accounting, and resolver-parity invariants be
proven independently of the pipeline re-point.

class EngineProviderBridge:
    """Adapt an :class:`LLMClient` to the engine's ``LLMProvider`` protocol.

    The engine calls :meth:`generate` with pre-rendered ``system`` / ``user``
    strings and expects ``(content, usage_dict)`` back. This bridge turns that
    into the ``[{role, content}, …]`` message list our clients consume, and —
    critically — records one :class:`LLMCallRecord` per call on :attr:`records`
    so the pipeline can reconstruct the exact audit trail the engine's
    ``NLResult`` token totals alone cannot express (provider, model, per-call
    cost). This mirrors ``pipeline._call_llm_raw`` field-for-field.

    A transport / provider exception is recorded as an error record (with
    ``cost_usd == 0.0``) and then **re-raised**, so the engine loop terminates
    on a real transport failure rather than validating an empty string and
    burning its retry budget.

    The returned ``content`` is the completion run through
    :func:`extract_sparql_from_response` — the same robust extractor the
    standalone pipeline used. The engine then applies its own
    ``_strip_code_fence`` to that text, but since already-extracted SPARQL is
    fence-free that call is a no-op. Doing extraction here (rather than relying
    on the engine's stricter, prefix-sensitive stripper) preserves the
    standalone pipeline's extraction semantics exactly, so a completion with
    leading prose (``"Here you go:\\n\\n```sparql…"``) is handled identically.
