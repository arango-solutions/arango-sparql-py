"""URI → ArangoDB collection / property resolution.

Wraps an in-memory ``rdflib.Graph`` loaded from the OWL/Turtle ontology
that ``arango-schema-mapper`` produces. The mapper's emitter
(``references/arango-schema-mapper/schema_analyzer/owl_export.py``)
attaches three annotation properties under the ``phys:`` namespace:

- ``phys:collectionName "..."`` on every ``owl:Class`` → ArangoDB
  document collection name.
- ``phys:edgeCollectionName "..."`` on every ``owl:ObjectProperty`` →
  ArangoDB edge collection name.
- ``phys:typeField`` / ``phys:typeValue`` for hybrid (multi-class)
  collections — used to emit ``FILTER doc.<typeField> == <typeValue>``.

The resolver normalizes every spelling of the physical IRI seen in the
wild so callers do not have to care which mapper version produced the
ontology. The canonical spelling is the one the analyzers actually emit
by default (``arango-schema-analyzer``'s
``DEFAULT_OWL_PHYSICAL_IRI = http://arangodb.com/schema/physical#``);
the older ``arango.solutions/phys#`` and ``arango-schema-mapper/phys#``
spellings are accepted for back-compat.

Visitors call into this resolver rather than touching the ontology
graph directly so the lookup surface stays narrow and cacheable.
