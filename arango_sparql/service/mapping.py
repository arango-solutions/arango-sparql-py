"""HTTP-shaped mapping helper for ``arango_sparql.service``.

Mirror of ``arango_cypher.service.mapping`` — single-function module
that adapts the wire JSON / inline Turtle payload on a translate /
execute / validate request into the in-memory
:class:`~arango_sparql.translate.resolver.SchemaResolver` the visitor
consumes.

Two payload shapes are recognised, in order of precedence:

1. ``req.ontology_ttl`` — a Turtle string carrying the OWL ontology
   produced by ``arango-schema-mapper``. Parsed into a fresh
   :class:`rdflib.Graph` and wrapped in a
   :class:`~arango_sparql.translate.resolver.SchemaResolver`. This is
   the path the ``/translate`` and ``/execute`` endpoints take today
   because it lets the UI ship a self-contained request without
   depending on a server-side cache.

2. ``req.mapping`` — a JSON dict. Today only the ``{"ttl": "<turtle>"}``
   key is honoured (which lets a JSON-only client tunnel a Turtle blob
   through the same field the Cypher project uses for its dict
   mapping). When the SPARQL service grows a richer wire shape — e.g.
   ``{"classes": [...], "properties": [...]}`` for a fully JSON-native
   mapping — extend :func:`_graph_from_request` here rather than at
   every call site.

When the caller supplies the analyzer-discovered :class:`MappingBundle`
for the connected database, :func:`_resolver_from_request` **merges** its
physical mapping into the inline ontology by local name (see
:func:`_enrich_graph_with_bundle`) so a user who queries a class they
declared but did not annotate still gets the discovered
``phys:collectionName`` rather than the local-name fallback.

Returns an *empty* resolver (graph with no triples) when neither
field is set. The resolver's unmapped-property fallback degrades any
bare URI to its local-name attribute, so simple SELECT queries
against an unmapped collection still work — see
``arango_sparql.translate.resolver.SchemaResolver.resolve_property``
for the contract. Callers that require a populated ontology should
validate the request before calling this helper.

# Analyzer-bundle merge (enrich the inline ontology with discovered mapping)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The translate/execute path's resolver is graph-based: it resolves a class
# IRI by reading the ``phys:*`` annotations on that IRI's ``owl:Class`` node.
# A hand-authored ontology (the Turtle a user types in the UI editor) rarely
# carries those annotations, so the resolver falls back to the IRI's local
# name and emits ``W_SCHEMA_DEFAULT_COLLECTION``.
#
# The arango-schema-analyzer *does* discover the physical mapping
# (collection names, edge collections, RPT columns, …) for the connected
# database, but it lands in a separate :class:`MappingBundle` keyed by entity
# *label* (local name) with synthetic ``urn:`` IRIs — so a blind graph union
# would never match the user's ``http://…#Person`` IRI.
#
# The merge therefore enriches *by local name*: for each ``owl:Class`` /
# ``owl:ObjectProperty`` in the inline graph, look up the analyzer entity /
# relationship with the same local name and copy its ``phys:*`` annotations
# onto the inline IRI — but only those the inline ontology did not already
# declare. Inline annotations always win; the bundle only fills gaps.

# Entity-spec field (analyzer-canonical camelCase) → ``phys:<local>`` the
# resolver reads. ``style`` is special-cased to ``phys:mappingStyle`` to match
# the synthesizer / resolver contract.
