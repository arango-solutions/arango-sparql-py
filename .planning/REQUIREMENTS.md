# Requirements: arango-sparql-py

**Defined:** 2026-07-15
**Core Value:** Deterministic W3C-grounded SPARQL→AQL correctness stays sacred (never regress), while NL→SPARQL translation quality becomes measurable and improvable.

> Source of the 16 PRD requirements: `docs/architecture/PRD.md` §3 "Success criteria
> (v1.0 acceptance)" — the declared contract, each criterion independently measurable
> by a named test/artefact. The 4 NL-* requirements are derived here for the active
> NL→SPARQL quality workstream (the eval harness + few-shot are the only real gaps in
> an otherwise-shipped v1).

## v1 Requirements

### Transpiler Core

- [x] **REQ-w3c-coverage** (PRD §3.1): W3C DAWG translation coverage ≥ 25%, no single XFAIL bucket > 30% of remaining failures. *Current: 96.4% query-eval; 30%-clause consciously accepted (dominant bucket = deferred SERVICE).* — acceptance: `tests/w3c/COVERAGE_REPORT.md`, `analyze_coverage.py --write`
- [x] **REQ-physical-model-coverage** (PRD §3.3): Correct AQL against every §6.1 shape — PG (`COLLECTION`), LPG (`LABEL`), RPT (`_triples`), plain `DOCUMENT`, PG+LPG hybrids, both edge styles. — acceptance: `tests/translate/{bgp_select,hybrid,rpt}.yml`, `tests/cross/*`
- [x] **REQ-hybrid-bgp-translation** (PRD §3.4): One BGP touching ≥ 2 physical models → single AQL query joined on shared subject URI. — acceptance: `tests/translate/hybrid.yml`, `tests/cross/test_hybrid_cross.py`
- [x] **REQ-schema-detection** (PRD §3.5): Both detectors ship (heuristic + analyzer-backed); analyzer wins on `strategy="auto"`; zero false negatives on fixture corpus. — acceptance: `tests/schema/test_classify.py`, `test_acquire.py`

### Protocol & HTTP Surface

- [x] **REQ-sparql-protocol-endpoint** (PRD §3.2): Conformant W3C SPARQL 1.1 Protocol endpoint — `GET/POST /sparql` accept negotiation (JSON/XML/CSV/TSV, RFC 9110 q-values); Service Description on empty GET; documented error contract (405/400/422/406/503/504/429/401). — acceptance: `tests/test_sparql_protocol_*.py`
- [x] **REQ-schema-http-parity** (PRD §3.6): All 9 schema/mapping HTTP routes exist with documented shapes, matching `arango-cypher-py`. — acceptance: `tests/test_service_schema_routes.py`

### Operational, Security & Privacy

- [x] **REQ-operational-parity** (PRD §3.8): Operational parity with `arango-cypher-py` — session/connect/public-mode/CORS/rate-limit/SSRF/redaction/startup-guard, one CI test per surface. — acceptance: `tests/parity/test_cypher_py_*.py`
- [x] **REQ-threat-model-mitigations** (PRD §3.13): Every §8.6 STRIDE row has its asserting test (CI-blocking). — acceptance: `tests/security/test_*.py`
- [x] **REQ-privacy-contract** (PRD §3.14): No-bodies-in-logs property test passes; `LOG_FORMAT=json` default emits §9.5 envelope; tenant-label toggles per §17.2. — acceptance: `tests/security/test_no_body_in_logs.py`, `tests/test_log_envelope.py`
- [x] **REQ-config-appendix-normative** (PRD §3.15): Adding a new env var without updating Appendix A fails CI. — acceptance: `tests/test_config_appendix.py`

### Interoperability & Performance

- [x] **REQ-foxx-parity** (PRD §3.7): **RETIRED** via ADR-0003 (Appendix B.3) — Foxx is deprecated; no v1.0 acceptance gate. See §13.4 amendment.
- [ ] **REQ-thirdparty-tool-compat** (PRD §3.10): Every §11.1 verified-compatible tool row has a passing smoke test (≥1 SELECT, 1 ASK, Service Description fetch) — Protégé, YASGUI, SPARQLWrapper, MS Ontology Playground. — acceptance: `tests/integration/test_*_compat.py`
- [ ] **REQ-ontoextract-integration** (PRD §3.11): `arango-ontoextract` can point its Q7 endpoint at us, seed via `/mapping/export-owl`, accept a curated OWL push via `/mapping/import-owl`. — acceptance: `tests/integration/test_aoe_roundtrip.py` (Docker-gated)
- [ ] **REQ-performance-slos** (PRD §3.12): Every §9.4 perf budget row passes within ≤ 25% of stated p95 (CI-blocking on > 25% regression). — acceptance: `tests/perf/test_*.py`

### UI Workbench

- [ ] **REQ-ui-parity** (PRD §3.9): UI feature parity with `arango-cypher-py` workbench — every §10.2/§10.3 capability-table row has a passing Playwright test. *Shell + most rows ship; Playwright/axe/Lighthouse harness deferred; WP-UI-CAT / WP-UI-TENANT / WP-UI-CORR backend-blocked.* — acceptance: `ui/tests/playwright/parity.spec.ts` (CI-blocking)

### NL→SPARQL Quality (ACTIVE workstream)

- [x] **NL-EVAL-01**: NL→SPARQL eval harness implemented — `tests/nl2sparql/eval/runner.py::run()` + `write_report()` (currently `NotImplementedError`) execute each corpus entry against each configured provider and emit JSON+Markdown reports; eval marker wired into CI. — acceptance: eval marker green in CI with a scripted provider
- [x] **NL-EVAL-02**: Seed corpus authored — `corpus.yml` + `configs.yml` created, `baseline.json` checked in as the regression gate; **NL→SPARQL pass-rate becomes a tracked metric**. — acceptance: `baseline.json` present; harness reports a numeric pass-rate
- [x] **NL-EVAL-03**: Harder eval corpus — grow `corpus.yml` beyond the 6 toy single-BGP cases to real-difficulty patterns (OPTIONAL, aggregation, property paths, multi-hop, plus negative/unsupported cases), each with a gold SPARQL judged by canonical algebra; corpus has genuine headroom (baseline pass-rate meaningfully below 1.0 with room for a few-shot lift). — acceptance: corpus contains the new pattern classes; `RUN_EVAL=1 pytest -m eval` green on the scripted config
- [x] **NL-EVAL-04**: Genuine live-model baseline — run the `openai` (real-provider) config against the harder corpus and check in a **credentials-gated** live-model `baseline.json` companion (scripted stays the no-network CI default; live run behind `RUN_EVAL=1` + provider key, never committing secrets). — acceptance: a live-model baseline artifact exists and is reproducible; CI still runs key-free on the scripted config
- [x] **NL-EVAL-05**: Execution-based (answer-set) judging for adopted benchmarks — the canonical exact-algebra judge floors real LLM output at 0% on adopted sets whose golds pre-resolve entity IRIs (07.1 live-eval finding), so add an opt-in `judge: execution` path that runs gold + candidate SPARQL through pyoxigraph and compares **answers** up to variable renaming + IRI↔label normalization (SELECT + ASK); vendor the CK25 instance graph (CC-BY-4.0, provenance-guarded) and record CK25's first execution-graded live accuracy number as the reported (not gated) corporate-domain anchor. QALD's DBpedia answer-subset capture is a separate later phase. — acceptance: `scripted-ck25` green (gold-vs-gold=100%) under execution judging; a live `openai-gpt4o-mini-ck25` execution-graded number recorded in `baseline.json`; scripted canonical CI default + W3C ≥96.4% guard unchanged
- [x] **NL-FEW-01**: Dense/embedding few-shot retrieval — wire the shared engine's few-shot seam through `SparqlAdapter.few_shot_index()` using a sentence-transformer (dense) retriever over the curated corpus (≤ 3 shots per rule-300), landing engine-side (`arango_query_core.nl.FewShotIndex`) so Cypher inherits it. BM25 is the fallback/ablation, not the primary. — acceptance: retrieved examples appear in the `NLQueryEngine`-built prompt's `## Examples` section; unit tests pass
- [x] **NL-FEW-02**: Measurable accuracy lift — dense few-shot run shows a **positive NL→SPARQL pass-rate delta over the Phase 06.2 live-model baseline** via the Phase 6 harness. — acceptance: eval report delta > 0 over the live baseline
- [x] **NL-ACC-01**: NL→SPARQL entity/instance grounding — productionize entity grounding as a language-agnostic seam in the shared `arango_query_core` NL engine (Cypher inherits it): retrieve candidate instance IRIs+labels for entities named in the question from the target instance data / a schema-agnostic index (never CK25-specific hand-curation, so it transfers to the CDF project), inject them into the prompt so the model binds to real IRIs instead of inventing them. Prove a **statistically significant, execution-graded** accuracy lift on the CK25 corporate anchor over the committed zero-shot baseline. Spike (2026-07-23) confirmed +12.2pt (6/49→12/49, McNemar p=0.031, 0 regressions, 96% IRI retrieval recall); execution-guided selection was tried and found ineffective (p=1.0) and is superseded. **CLOSED via the significant-lift path** (07.3-06, credentialed live sweep 2026-07-23/24): grounded 14/49 (0.2857) vs a freshly-run-same-session zero arm 5/49 (0.1020), paired McNemar b=9/c=0/p=0.0039, bootstrap delta +0.1837 CI[0.0816, 0.3061], ZERO regressions — stronger than the pre-planning spike, same direction. — acceptance: live execution-graded CK25 config shows a significant positive delta (McNemar p<0.05) over the recorded baseline with zero regressions; scripted configs stay the no-network CI default; W3C DAWG coverage ≥96.4% and the SPARQL→AQL transpiler package unchanged — evidence: `tests/nl2sparql/eval/baseline.json:configs.openai-gpt4o-mini-ck25-grounded.confirmatory_test`, `tests/nl2sparql/eval/README.md` §9
- [x] **NL-ACC-02**: NL→SPARQL predicate/schema-convention grounding — mechanically-derived TBox predicate index (label + domain + range + object-vs-datatype + usage-shape, walked purely from `rdfs:domain`/`rdfs:range` declarations, no hand-curated per-schema hints so it transfers to CDF, D-02) injected as a new engine seam-7 prompt block (`predicate_index()`/`predicate_prompt_section()` on `QueryLanguageAdapter`, D-06/D-07), composed after the entity block inside `NLQueryEngine._system_prompt`, targeting the 17 convention-bound CK25 failures left over after entity grounding. Prove a **statistically significant, execution-graded** CK25 lift over the NL-ACC-01 entity-grounded baseline (`baseline.json:openai-gpt4o-mini-ck25-grounded` = 14/49), McNemar p<0.05, zero regressions; directional QALD-9-plus generalization check (first-ever live run of the powered gate, zero-shot + predicate-grounded — reported, not gated, D-03). No CK25-specific hand-curation (mechanical schema walk only, D-02); scripted configs stay the sole CI-reachable default; W3C DAWG coverage ≥96.4% and the SPARQL→AQL transpiler package unchanged (D-08). **CLOSED via the DOCUMENTED-NULL path on a VALID experiment (07.4-06 re-fold, credentialed live re-sweep 2026-07-27 on the fixed dump mode, `arango_query_core` pin `b66932046a102898e8fff205a7ddcbedfb2c896e`, NL-FEW-02 precedent — NOT a passed confirmatory lift):** the 07.4-05 sweep this closure originally rested on ran against a dump-mode defect (CR-01: widening `k` to the total predicate count was a no-op against the shared scorer's zero-hit filter, so a typical CK25 question surfaced only 1–8 of 30 predicates). 07.4-06 fixed CR-01 upstream and the credentialed human RE-RAN the full live CK25 sweep on the fixed dump mode (same session for both arms, paired against one fresh entity-alone arm of 12/49 = 0.2449). Clean, valid results: standalone seam-7 (predicate-alone, entity block removed) has a worse point estimate than entity-alone but is **not** statistically significant (7/49 = 0.1429 vs the fresh 12/49 entity-alone arm, paired McNemar b=1/c=6/p=0.1250, bootstrap delta=-0.1020, CI₉₅[-0.2041, 0.0] — 6 losses/1 gain, softened from 07.4-05's confounded wrong-direction-significant p=0.0156); the phase's actually-intended composition, seam-7 ADDITIVE on top of seam-6 entity grounding, is a non-significant wash with a slightly lower point estimate (10/49 = 0.2041 vs the same fresh 12/49 entity-alone arm, paired McNemar b=2/c=4/p=0.6875, bootstrap delta=-0.0408, CI₉₅[-0.1429, 0.0612] — 4 losses/2 gains, achieved MDE pi_0.20=0.179/pi_0.25=0.2001 at n=49 per `power.py::achieved_mde`). Notably 2 genuine additive wins (ck25-8, ck25-11) show real case-level signal, offset by 4 distraction losses (ck25-6, ck25-12, ck25-30, ck25-49) — a schema-info-overload pattern, not simple irrelevance. QALD-9-plus directional generalization (unaffected by CR-01 — retrieve mode, k=20, never in the dump-mode path; not re-run) sits at the floor for both arms (1/514 zero-shot, 3/514 predicate-grounded; achieved MDE ≈5.5–6.2pt at n=514, so +2 cases is noise, never gated per D-03/D-04). The overall disposition (fails the hard gate, closes via documented-null) is unchanged from 07.4-05's conclusion, but now rests on a valid, unconfounded experiment rather than a broken dump mode. Documented follow-up: predicate grounding shows case-level signal (real wins on ck25-8/ck25-11) but nets ~zero-to-negative due to distraction losses; the next experiment should try **selective predicate surfacing** (only predicates relevant to the question's target class), not a full dump or naive token-match retrieval. — acceptance: live execution-graded CK25 predicate-grounded config shows a significant positive delta (McNemar p<0.05) over the recorded entity-grounded baseline with zero regressions [NOT MET — documented null instead]; QALD-9-plus zero-shot-vs-predicate-grounded directional delta recorded (not gated) [MET]; scripted configs stay the no-network CI default; W3C DAWG coverage ≥96.4% and the SPARQL→AQL transpiler package unchanged — evidence: `tests/nl2sparql/eval/baseline.json:configs.openai-gpt4o-mini-ck25-predicate-grounded.confirmatory_test`, `:phase07_4_predicate_grounding_sweep.ck25_additive_arm`, `:phase07_4_predicate_grounding_sweep.qald9plus_directional`.

### NL to SPARQL Benchmark Adoption (ACTIVE)

<!-- Phase 07.1: adopting public, human-authored NL→SPARQL benchmark sets (QALD-9-plus,
     CK25) instead of building a synthetic-corpus generator (retired via a /grill-me
     design review, 2026-07-22 — see 07.1-CONTEXT.md D-01..D-09). These IDs are
     NEWLY PROPOSED for this phase; the retired synthetic-corpus-growth phase's
     requirement ids (see 07.1-CONTEXT.md for the former prefix) are VOID and must
     never be reused. -->

- [x] **NL-BENCH-01**: QALD-9-plus adopted — `convert_qald.py` turns QALD-JSON (English DBpedia train+test) into `corpus.yml`-shaped cases; a minimal DBpedia ontology subset (Turtle, `phys:`-annotated) is authored covering exactly the kept questions' classes/properties; `filter_log.md` records kept/dropped counts and reasons (D-06). — acceptance: `tests/nl2sparql/eval/vendored/qald9plus/{corpus.yml,filter_log.md,NOTICE.md}` present; `RUN_EVAL=1 pytest tests/nl2sparql/eval/test_gold_transpilable.py -k qald9plus` green
- [x] **NL-BENCH-02**: CK25 adopted — `convert_ck25.py` turns `questions.yml` into cases; the schema triples embedded in `graphs/prod-inst.ttl` (`owl:Class`/`owl:ObjectProperty` + `rdfs:domain`/`rdfs:range`) are extracted and `phys:`-annotated; `filter_log.md` recorded (D-06). — acceptance: `tests/nl2sparql/eval/vendored/ck25/{corpus.yml,filter_log.md,NOTICE.md}` present; `RUN_EVAL=1 pytest tests/nl2sparql/eval/test_gold_transpilable.py -k ck25` green
- [x] **NL-BENCH-03**: Refusal supplement — 9 `expect_refusal` cases keyed to genuinely-unsupported transpiler features (drift-proof malformed-`scripted:` triggers + real `UnsupportedSparqlError` sites), matching the existing 3-case convention. — acceptance: `RUN_EVAL=1 pytest -m eval -k refusal` green; all 9 pass the inverted judge (`outcome.aql == ""`)
- [x] **NL-BENCH-04**: Power-analysis module ported — `tests/nl2sparql/eval/power.py::required_n`/`achieved_mde` (pure-Python, Connor-1987 McNemar sizing, no scipy) with unit tests; achieved MDE computed and reported for QALD (powered gate, N=514) and CK25 (anchor, reported not gated, N=49). — acceptance: `pytest tests/nl2sparql/eval/test_power.py` green; `baseline.json`'s `scripted-qald9plus`/`scripted-ck25` entries carry `achieved_mde`
- [x] **NL-BENCH-05**: Harness wiring — `configs.yml` gets per-set config entries (`scripted-qald9plus`, `scripted-ck25`, live `openai-gpt4o-mini-{qald9plus,ck25}` variants); `runner.py` gets the ONE additive `corpus:` config-key change (default-preserving — every pre-existing config behaves byte-identically); scripted `baseline.json` regenerated with the new, SEPARATE per-set entries (never blended with the hand-authored `scripted` entry or each other). — acceptance: `pytest tests/nl2sparql/eval/test_eval.py -k corpus_path_default` green; `RUN_EVAL=1 pytest tests/nl2sparql/eval/test_eval.py` green
- [x] **NL-BENCH-06**: Vendored data + provenance — CC-BY-4.0 `NOTICE.md` (source URL/commit + attribution) under `tests/nl2sparql/eval/vendored/{qald9plus,ck25}/`; no secrets; no raw multilingual JSON blobs beyond the pruned English-only extract needed. — acceptance: `pytest tests/nl2sparql/eval/test_vendored_provenance.py` green
- [x] **NL-BENCH-07**: Non-regression — deterministic SPARQL→AQL transpiler untouched; W3C DAWG query-eval coverage stays ≥ 96.4%; `scripted` remains the sole CI-reachable config (`test_ci_gate_only_ever_runs_scripted` stays green for every new `scripted-qald9plus`/`scripted-ck25` config). — acceptance: `pytest tests/nl2sparql/eval/test_eval.py -k ci_gate_only_ever_runs_scripted` green; `pytest tests/w3c/test_coverage_gate.py` green (or skips key-free when the W3C corpus isn't fetched locally)

### Release

- [ ] **REQ-public-release-readiness** (PRD §3.16): Repo public; CI green on Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 + ArangoDB 3.11/3.12; MIT LICENSE + CONTRIBUTING + SECURITY + operational runbook; repeatable `docker compose up` dev loop; SBOM on the v1.0 release tag. — acceptance: GitHub releases page, CI history, `docker compose up && curl /health/ready`

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in the current roadmap.

- **SERVICE / federated query** — Service Description would advertise `sd:BasicFederatedQuery`; dominant W3C XFAIL bucket
- **DEC-0002 Option B/C** — Document-emulated cross-subject OPTIONAL (+0.8pp W3C) and full multi-model `_uri→collection` resolution; travel with the federation slice
- **SPARQL 1.1 Update** — write path; currently 405

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| SPARQL 1.1 Update (INSERT/DELETE/LOAD/…) | Writes go through AQL directly; endpoint returns 405 |
| Federated query (`SERVICE`) | Deferred to possible v2; no `sd:BasicFederatedQuery` |
| RDFS/OWL inferencing/reasoning | Ontology is mapping metadata, not a reasoning surface |
| Cross-process multi-tenancy | Sessions per-process in-memory; needs sticky-session LB |
| Replacing AQL | This is a transpiler, not a competing engine |
| Asking the LLM for AQL directly | Forbidden by rule-300; LLM emits SPARQL only |
